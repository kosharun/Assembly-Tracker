## Assembly-Tracker

Assembly Tracker is a web app, made using Django Python framework, for tracking team meetings.

App's purpose is to be helpful to teams or organizations that have meetings regularly.

These are the guidelines on how to use the app:

	The Organization or a team creates it's personal account through the register page.
	After a successful authentication the app provides abilities like:
		- creating a meeting
		- adding team members
		- insight into cash register

	Firstly add your team member names through the Members page.
		
	Now create a new meeting by filling up all required fields.
	Based on the date that you are creating your meeting on, automatic fields for "monthly cash register" are loaded(for current month, also for months in which no meetings were held.)
	Check the present members.

	OPTIONAL: Add agenda item:
				- This is the topic that you are talking about in that meeting. You can add free text for that topic.
				Also you can create multiple agenda items.

	Click save!

	Congratulations! You have created your first meeting.

	Now you can have fun looking through the insights provided by the app based on the meetings you create.
	For example if you go to the homepage you can see a list of meetings that you have created.
	When you open one of them you have options to edit that meeting, remove it and also download it as a PDF on your local machine.

	On the "Members" tab, a table that tracks the presence of your team members is visible.
	For each member a card is displayed and clickable. If you click one of them you can see how many times the member was present based on the number of meetings.

	SPECIAL FEATURE:
	This feature is accessible through the "Cash" tab and it provides you a yearly insight for your Cash register's Income, Exit and Transfer for each month using Graphs.

	You can log out and create a new team's account with it's personal meetings, members etc.

Feel free to advise me with ideas to improve my app.
