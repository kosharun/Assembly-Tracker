# Assembly-Tracker


Assembly Tracker is a web app, made using Django Python-based web Framework, for tracking team meetings.
App's purpose is to be helpful to teams or organizations that have meetings regularly.

These are the guidelines on how to use the app:

## Create team account


The Organization or a team creates it's personal account through the register page.

After a successful authentication the app provides abilities like:
- creating a meeting
- adding team members
- insight into cash register



## Firstly add your team member names through the Members page

### Now create a new meeting by filling up all required fields


Based on the date that you are creating your meeting on, automatic fields for "monthly cash register" are loaded(for current month, also for months in which no meetings were held).
Check the present members.

Click save!

## Congratulations! You have created your first meeting.


Now you can have fun looking through the insights provided by the app based on the meetings you create.
For example if you go to the homepage you can see a list of meetings that you have created.
When you open one of them you have options to edit that meeting, remove it and also download it as a PDF on your local machine.
